SET OPERATORS:
==============

IT WILL COMBINE THE RESULTS OF TWO QUERIES AND SHOW IT AS ONE RESULT.
WE HAVE 4 TYPES OF SET OPERATORS

UNION: EXTRACTS THE RESULTS FROM BOTH THE QUERIES EXCLUDING DUPLICATES
UNION ALL : EXTRACTS THE RESULTS FROM BOTH THE QUERIES INCLUDING  DUPLICATES
INTERSECT : EXTRACTS THE RESULTS COMMON TO BOTH THE QUERIES
MINUS     : EXTRACTS THE RESULTS FROM 1ST QUERY WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN 2ND QUERY RESULTS.

IN ORDER BY CLAUSE WE CAN MENTION ONLY COLUMN POSTION NUMBER IF WE ARE USING THE SET OPERATORS AS COLUMN_NAMES OR ALIAS NAMES CAN BE DIFFERENT
SAME NUMBER OF COLUMNS SHOULD BE THERE IN BOTH THE QUERIES.
COLUMN NAMES CAN BE DIFFERENT BUT DATATYPES SHOULD BE SAME
THERE IS NO LIMITATION ON THE NUMBER OF QUERIES.IF WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE SET OPERATOR IN THE QUERY THEN EXUCUTION WILL BE DONE FROM TOP TO BUTTOM
( () FIRST PRIORITY)

SELECT EMPNO,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7698,7782)
UNION
SELECT EMPNO EMPLOYEE_NUMBER,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7566,7788)
ORDER BY 1

EMPNO	ENAME

7566	JONES
7698	BLAKE
7782	CLARK
7788	SCOTT
7839	KING


( SELECT EMPNO EMPLOYEE_NUMBER,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7698,7782) ORDER BY EMPNO
  OR
  SELECT EMPNO EMPLOYEE_NUMBER,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7698,7782) ORDER BY   1
  OR 
  SELECT EMPNO EMPLOYEE_NUMBER,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7698,7782) ORDER BY  EMPLOYEE_NUMBER )

IN ORDER BY CLAUSE WE CAN MENTION ONLY COLUMN POSTION NUMBER IF WE ARE USING THE SET OPERATORS AS COLUMN_NAMES OR ALIAS NAMES CAN BE DIFFERENT



UNION ALL
---------

SELECT EMPNO,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7698,7782)
UNION ALL
SELECT EMPNO EMPLOYEE_NUMBER,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7566,7788)
ORDER BY 1

EMPNO	ENAME

7566	JONES
7698	BLAKE
7782	CLARK
7788	SCOTT
7839	KING
7839	KING  -DUPLICATED


SELECT EMPNO,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7698,7782)
UNION 
SELECT EMPNO EMPLOYEE_NUMBER,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7566,7788)
ORDER BY 1

IN ABOVE CASE EVEN IF WE USE UNION ALL THE RESULT WILL BE SAME
IE, IF WE KNOW THAT THERE NO DUPLICATES THEN UNION AND UNION ALL RESULT WILL BE SAME.AT THIS TIME WHICH ONE WILL BE BETTER PERFORMANCE WISE?
-----------------------------

Answer : UNION ALL
union will  compare each and every ROW (empno,ename) wITH OTHER ROWS TO FIND THE DUPLICATES.
BUT IN UNION ALL THERE WONT BE ANY COMPARISION SO PERFORMANCE WILL BE FASTER.

INTERSECT
-----------

SELECT EMPNO,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7698,7782)
INTERSECT
SELECT EMPNO EMPLOYEE_NUMBER,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7566,7788)
ORDER BY 1

7839 KING

MINUS
-----------

SELECT EMPNO,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7698,7782)
MINUS
SELECT EMPNO EMPLOYEE_NUMBER,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO IN (7839,7566,7788)
ORDER BY 1

EMPNO	ENAME

7698	BLAKE
7782	CLARK


I WANT TO SEE ALL THE EMPLOYEE AND HIS SALARY,DEPTNO WISE MAX SALARY,MAX SAL 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,DEPTNO,SAL FROM EMP
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL EMPNO,NULL ENAME,DEPTNO,MAX(SAL) FROM EMP
GROUP BY DEPTNO
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL EMPNO,NULL ENAME,NULL DEPTNO,MAX(SAL) FROM EMP
ORDER BY 1,2,3,4
