Oracle is a RDBMS

RDBMS -> Relational Database management system.


Data:   Collection of interrelated information


Address : Door no: 1/1234   
          block  : A block
          Street : MG road
          city   : Banglore
          country : india
          

Database: Where data is organized in proper manner
   ex: Notepad
Database management System : DBMS
set of programs which will organization the data in proper mannager


BEfore DBMS came into the picture we were using notepads,excelsheets,MS WORD ETC.(FMS-file management System)

emp.xls

empno ename  deptno
101    a      10
102    b      20
103    c      10

dept.xls
deptno dname
10     sales
20     admin

i want see the data like

101   a  sales
102   b   admin

Disadvantage:
1) we cant join two files
2) not secured (any body can access)
3) Easily editable



Types of DBMS
-------
Hdbms  ->Hierarchy DBMS
Ndbms  -> Network DBMS
Rdbms  -> Relational DBMS


Hierarchy DBMS
---------------
Data will be stored in the form of the hierarchy
  
                               HOD1


                    L1       L2      L3    L4

               s1   s2 s3   s4 s5   s3 s4   s3

Disadvantages: we need to change the same data in N number of places


Network DBMS:
---------------
Data will be stored in the form of the sets


    roll no       Name
   
     R1           
                  abc
     R2

Disadvantages : Data is not organized in proper manner

Relational DBMS:
-----------------
data will be stored in tables (Rows and columns)

table : student
roll no   name
r1        abc
r2        abc


DR EF Codd designed the  rdbms model in 1960

EF codd rules :
----------------
we need to follow codd rules while desinging the RDBMS
12 rules

1)    All the data should be stored in the form of table.
2)    Every column should accept null values
        ename empid  sal   DA
         a     101   10000  2%
         b     102   30000  
         c     103  
3)  With out any ambiguity we have to retrieve the data
4)  We have to access the table structure by the same tools which access the data
     select * from emp
         ename empid  sal   DA
         a     101   10000  2%  
         b     102   30000  
         c     103 
    
5) Every RDBMS should have one clearly defined language to insert, delete, retrieve…. the data  
    Oracle -> sql & PLSQL
   
6) Data may be presented in the different logical combinations (views).any operation on this view should 
                  be effected to tables (**Discuss one views concept is done)
7)Any no. of rows should be effected when we perform insert, delete and update etc...

   delete from emp where empno=101;--1 row deleted
   delete from emp; -- 3 rows deleted (We are doing with single statement not multiple statements)
       
8)  Data should not be effected even though storage architecture changes.

    present i have 2gb ram...now i have upgraded to 8gb.then also data should not be effected.
     
9) Data should not be effected even though table structure changes

   i will add/drop some columns but existing data should not be effected
    
10) Data should not be effected even though data is stored in different locations.
     Even thoough data is stored in different servers data should not be effected

11)     Data base should support constraints for security
         empid and salary should not be null
     
12) There should be no way to modify the database structure other than the data base language (sql).

     modify anything in the oracle when it should allow only sql-plsql.It should not allow other languages

No data base will satisfy the entire codd’s rules. A data base which satisfies more than half of the codd rules it is good 
data base.
